# Mapbender module

This is the Mapbender module, the main-component of the [Mapbender application](https://mapbender.org).

This module works like a library and can not run for itself. It has to be integrated in the [Mapbender-Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter), which is the starting-environment for building Mapbender. The module is loaded via Composer in the [composer.json of Mapbender-Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/HEAD/application/composer.json).

This Mapbender module contains most functionality of Mapbender itself, from the map to the different searches. These elements are described in the [user-documentation](https://doc.mapbender.org/).

To build and develop Mapbender itself refer to the [Contributing Guide in Mapbender-Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To use Mapbender refer to the [user-documentation](http://doc.mapbender.org) ([Github source](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-documentation)).
